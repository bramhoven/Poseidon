# Poseidon
Open Source solution for managing large server fleets. Easy to use REST API to deploy and manage servers in different cloud providers from one location.

### Introduction
Poseidon is being developed to be an easy to use server fleet managing software. It will be able to create servers across many different cloud providers like AWS, OVH, DigitalOcean, Azure and on on-premise hosting like ESXi.

It will also be able to do health checks on those servers and retrieve custom data. It will then provide the functionality to filter those servers based on that custom data.
